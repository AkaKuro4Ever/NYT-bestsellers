Planning Out the Project:
Goal: A command line interface that will list the books presented on the homepage of the NYT bestseller list.
It will be able to list by genre (5 in all), list all books, list by author.
User can select a book to learn more, or by the two categories if it's on 'list all books'.
Each book description will hold its place in line, the title, the author, how long it's been on the list, and the description.
Then, the user will be able to go back to choose a new book or new category to look at. It will also end the CLI if input indicates they don't want to look at any more books.
